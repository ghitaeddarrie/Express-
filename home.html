            HTML stands for HyperText Markup 
            Language. It is used to design 
            web pages using a markup language.
            HTML is the combination of Hypertext
            and Markup language. Hypertext 
            defines the link between the web 
            pages. A markup language is used 
            to define the text document within 
            tag which defines the structure of 
            web pages. HTML is a markup language
            that is used by the browser to 
            manipulate text, images, and other
            content to display it in the required 
            format.

            C is a procedural programming language.
            It was initially developed by Dennis 
            Ritchie as a system programming 
            language to write operating system. 
            The main features of C language include
            low-level access to memory, simple set 
            of keywords, and clean style, these 
            features make C language suitable for
            system programming like operating system 
            or compiler development.

        Java has been one of the most 
        popular programming language 
        for many years. Java is Object 
        Oriented. However it is not 
        considered as pure object oriented
        as it provides support for primitive
        data types (like int, char, etc) The
        Java codes are first compiled into byte
        code (machine independent code). Then
        the byte code is run on Java Virtual
        Machine (JVM) regardless of the
        underlying architecture.
